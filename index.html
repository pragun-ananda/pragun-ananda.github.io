    <p>
        I'm a software engineer at Google. I recently graduated from UVA
        with degrees in computer science and statistics. <br> This website is a
        work in progress, but I plan on adding more content to it in the coming weeks. <br>
        I'm not a design-driven person so don't expect it to look very different when it's done :)
